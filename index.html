          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Sometimes ensuring that your organization succeeds seems more difficult than you expected, particularly when the members of your board have lots of skills but not the understanding of how to apply them in a board context.  When boards, CEOs, and leadership teams thrive, entire organizations succeed with them. But the effectiveness of your leadership team may be endangered by such issues as personal differences, lack of strategic alignment, or failures of structure and governance.  Larry advises Boards on how to optimize their overall effectiveness, committee effectiveness, and individual director effectiveness.  He assists CEOs to optimize leadership effectiveness, impact, and legacy.</p>
            <p>He can help you achieve alignment on strategic direction and risk, secure the right people for the right executive roles, and build the leadership capabilities necessary to deliver superior business performance.</p>
            <p>Improving the performance and impact of the board.</p>
            <p>Research indicates that there are three key elements that influence board effectiveness:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Composition &ndash; does the board have the right mix of members?</li>
                <li>Focus &ndash; do the members of the board have a shared focus on the organization’s strategy and capabilities?</li>
                <li>Team dynamics &ndash; could board members be working together more effectively?</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Focus on these three elements in concert while helping to build an effective governance model. Larry is able to offer solutions in a range of areas, including board composition, strategic alignment, team effectiveness, and succession.</p>

            <p>When boards, CEOs and leadership teams thrive, entire organizations succeed with them. Governance and compliance remain significant issues that Boards must address, but are only part of the story. Forward-looking boards should move ‘beyond compliance’ and focus on behavioral and relationship issues that shape board dynamics and drive board and organizational performance. Through workshops, Board Policy Manual development and one-on-one coaching, we help boards provide structure and shape relationships, culture and the team dynamics that underpin success.</p>
